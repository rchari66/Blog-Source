        ```
    
* UDP(User Datagram Protocal)
    * Description - provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability. 
    * protocal - UDP
    * port - NA
    * Encryption -

    * port - Does not use TCP or UDP. 

* SSH
    * protocal - SSH
    * port - 22
